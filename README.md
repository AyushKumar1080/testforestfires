# testforestfires
This project combines machine learning with Flask-based web development to build an interactive platform for predicting forest fire risks in Algeria. Using a dataset containing meteorological and fire-related attributes, the model evaluates environmental conditions—such as temperature, wind speed, etc. —to estimate the Fire Weather Index (FWI).
